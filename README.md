# Chess Engine with FEN Integration

FEN or Forsyth-Edwards Notation is a common notation used in computer to tell the position of a given chess game at any moment, from the pieces in each rank, the current turn, the possibility of castling, En Passant squares. 

Such a notation can be chained together to do a multitude of things to help you understand your games better, particularly when it comes to reviewing your game after a match has ended! Which is exactly what our app allows you to do!

## Features
- Moving back and forth the match
- Redo / retake moves you didn't mean to
- Export and import Match History
- 2 Player, turn-based, good ol' fashioned Chess

## Running through Windows
You can install the game either by directly downloading the ZIP of the **source code** and navigating to one of the folders (Array List, Linked List, Hash Map, choose whichever one). 
Then clicking directly onto one of the folders allows you to find a **exe** file.
Double clicking this **exe** file (note that this only works for Windows Operating Systems **only**)
Have fun!

## Running through other OS
Install the **source code**.
Navigate into one of the variants and into the **src** folder.
Open the *ChessApplication.java* in a suitable Java IDE before running it there!
